What is a Product?
------------------

|

Products are the merchandise offered to a market to satisfy a want or need. It is created through a process and provides benefits to a market.
A chair, a table, or ‘set of furniture’ related to the dining room are examples of products. Similarly, a product can also be an idea or a service. In the CS Global System, a product can be a placeholder for a group of items of the same model or a  standalone item up for sale. Here, you can create a product, enrich it with images, videos and classify  it.

To give our customers liberty of displaying the products in the most attractive manner and to aid the promotional activities, we have introduced various types of products, a detailed account of same is described in the following section.


What are the types of Products in the system?
---------------------------------------------

The CS Global System allows you to create a variety of products. Each type of product has a unique set of values/attributes assigned to it. Having various types of products enhances its use and makes it more relevant. Say, A chair is a good standalone product to sell, but a Dining Table usually sells with chairs.

Single Article
--------------

A Single Article is a standalone sellable item. This product type is usually used to create independent products. Say –a chair, a table-lamp, a mattress and so on. These Single Articles can be sold individually or grouped together to make a bundle. E.g. Furnishing items like chair, table, sofa, table-lamp are individual items for sale; when put together in a bundle they form ‘living room set’.
