Manage Master Taxonomies
==========================
The Manage Master Taxonomies is an admin feature that sets up Master Taxonomies that are based on Masters so that each level of taxonomy is represented by a Master Tag Group.

**Key Term:**           * **Taxonomy:** a taxonomy is a scheme of classification used for an organizationâ€™s products.

**Description:**        * Taxonomy is concerned with the classification of various products.
                          Taxonomies can also represent related concepts that can be used to connect a product to a various level of branches of a taxonomy.
                        * This feature is about how to map a product to different concepts and terms in order to maintain a consistent structure.

**Application:**        * This feature helps to multi-classify a product.
                        * This feature drives information through the applied taxonomy.
                        * This feature gives the product a hierarchy to show all the related concepts.
                        * *Example:*

                            An electronics retailer, who sells various electronics products, would like to further categorize them.
                            The 'Mobile Phones' he sells may have a taxonomy 'Electronics' under which he will create a number of levels to classify his mobile phones.
                            So, the mobile phone will fall under two categories - *Smartphones or Basic phones*.
                            The smartphones category will further have branches - *Touchscreen or Keypad* and so on.
                            Similarly, various taxonomies can be applied to other electronics for easy categorization.
