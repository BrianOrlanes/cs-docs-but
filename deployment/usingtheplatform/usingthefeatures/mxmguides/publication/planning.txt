**Slot:** the :doc:`Slot </deployment/usingtheplatform/usingthefeatures/mxmguides/templates/slots>` is a place in a document template where a product is placed while planning the document template in Whiteboard.
A planner will split the defined Workable Area of a document template into N number of rows and columns according to his need in Whiteboard. Thus, he will create a slot, which is a separate space for each product.
Now, a planner can place products into separate slots, where one slot  will contain a single product.

**Workable Area:** the :doc:`Workable Area </deployment/usingtheplatform/usingthefeatures/mxmguides/templates/workablearea>` is defined while creating a document template in Adobe © InDesign ©.
A designer will define this area using an Adobe © InDesign © frame in a document template. The Workable Area is a dynamic area where products will be placed in Desktop Publisher.


Overview
=========
Whiteboard is a feature in Contentserv system, which is similar to Adobe © InDesign © application.
There are two types of target audience who will be involved in the publications. One is a planner who will actually plan the publication.
The other one is a designer who will make the layout and prepare the templates using Adobe © InDesign © software.
Whiteboard will help the planner to plan how a publication should look like.
