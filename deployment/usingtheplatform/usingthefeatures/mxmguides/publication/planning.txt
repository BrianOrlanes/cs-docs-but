Key Terms
==========

**Slot:** a slot is a place in a document template where a product is placed while planning of a document template in Whiteboard. The planner will split the defined Workable Area of a document template into N number of rows and columns according to his need in Whiteboard. Thus, he will create a slot, which is a separate space for each product. Now, a planner can place products into separate slots, where one slot will contain a single product.

**Workable Area:** the workable area is defined while creating a document template in Adobe © InDesign ©. A designer will define this area using an Adobe © InDesign © frame in a document template. A planner will use the workable area in the Whiteboard to plan and place the products in it.


Overview
=========
Whiteboard is a feature in Contentserv system, which is similar to Adobe © InDesign © application. There are two types of the target audience who will be involved in the publications. One is a planner who will actually plan the publication. The other one is a designer, who will make the layout and will prepare the templates using Adobe © InDesign © software. Whiteboard will help the planner to plan how a publication should look like.
