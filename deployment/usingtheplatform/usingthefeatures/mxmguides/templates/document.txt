Document Template
===================

Document template contains guides, styles, page attribute placeholders, "static" elements, and so on.
A designer starts the preparation of document template using Adobe © InDesign ©. It is a physical .indd  Adobe © InDesign © file.
It does not contain actual information, only the layout and data dimension. It serves as a starting point of a document.
A designer can define the Workable Area in a document template, where a planner can plan and place the products.
A designer can use the rest of the area of a document template, which is not defined as the Workable Area, to place the header, footer, logo, or background image.

Once you create the document template in Adobe © InDesign ©, you can play with it using the Whiteboard of Contentserv system.
You can plan how products should be placed in a document template using Whiteboard. You can define Slots in a document template to place the products in the using Whiteboard.
These document templates are used in creating publication templates.

**Purpose:**               * The purpose of this document is to explain what a Document Template is and how to create it.
                             You will be guided through the different stages that are involved in building a new document template.

**Target Audience:**       * System Administrators
                           * Template Designers

**Key Terms**              * **CS Desktop Publisher:** the :doc:`Desktop Publisher </deployment/usingtheplatform/usingthefeatures/mxmguides/templates/csdesktoppublisher>`
                             is a plugin for simple data  transfer and updating functions. It is available as an additional option for templates and dynamic editing in the print sector.
                             The Desktop Publisher allows you to use and update Contentserv system objects in Adobe © InDesign © documents.
                             Frames and individual texts will be assigned to variables which can connect them to system objects like products or images.
                             This will allow for ease of creating and updating documents which are based on an object or document template.

                           * **Whiteboard:** :doc:`Whiteboard </deployment/usingtheplatform/usingthefeatures/mxmguides/templates/whiteboard>`
                             is a Contentserv feature that is similar to Adobe © InDesign © application.
                             There are two types of target audiences who will be involved in the publications.
                             One is a planner who will actually plan the publication.
                             The other one is a designer who will make the layout and prepare the templates using Adobe © InDesign © software.
                             Desktop Publisher will help the planner to plan how a publication should look like.

                           * **Workable Area:** the :doc:`Workable Area </deployment/usingtheplatform/usingthefeatures/mxmguides/templates/workablearea>`
                             is defined while creating a :doc:`document template </deployment/usingtheplatform/usingthefeatures/mxmguides/templates/documenttemplate>`
                             in Adobe © InDesign ©. A designer will define this area using an Adobe © InDesign © frame in a document template.
                             The Workable Area is a dynamic area where products will be placed in Desktop Publisher.

                           * **Slot:** the :doc:`Slot </deployment/usingtheplatform/usingthefeatures/mxmguides/templates/slots>`
                             is a place in a document template where a product is placed while planning the document template in Whiteboard.
                             A planner will split the defined Workable Area of a document template into N number of rows and columns according to his need in Whiteboard.
                             Thus, he will create a slot, which is a separate space for each product. Now, a planner can place products into separate slots,
                             where one slot will contain a single product.
