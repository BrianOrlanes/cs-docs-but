Purpose

This document will help you create ‘Product Template’ in Adobe InDesign ©.


Target Audience
================
Template Designers, Graphic Designers, System Administrators.


Overview
=========
Product template in Adobe © InDesign © or Whiteboard is used to create single page templates of marketing products. You can add images and text to a pre-defined workable area and design it as per the marketing requirement. It has both a layout and a data representation which is managed in their own structure.

A product template may consist of one or more Adobe © InDesign © frames that can be directly associated with attribute placeholders within the frame or on the frame (e.g., text, image, table).

Placement options (e.g., Fit content to frames, Fit frames to content), and paragraph styles (including GREP styles) are assigned to the frame via Adobe © InDesign © functionality. The frames of a product template can be placed on different levels. By saving and naming a product template, it is read into the PXP system.

The value for the entire length and width of the elements of the basic template is determined (size of the rectangle enclosing all frames).

When enriching the template in the PXP system (outside of Adobe © InDesign ©), the following information is collected:

  *  Size (length, width)
  *  Initially filled Distribution Channels (VTS): for which distribution channels the template can be used (see distinction/tagging)
  *  Assortment Validity: for which assortment ranges the template can be used (see distinction/tagging)
