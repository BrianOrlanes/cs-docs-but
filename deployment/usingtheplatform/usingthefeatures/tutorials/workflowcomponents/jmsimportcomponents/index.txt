=======================
JMS Import Components
=======================
The PXP system will receive the message from the consumer messaging server while onboarding.
The message contains the JSON object, which contains the details of different entities of the system like an article, assets, relationships, and so on.
The PXP system will fetch all the details from the JSON object, and it will onboard all the products and other details into the system.
Once the PXP system receives the message from the consumer system, it will send the acknowledgment to the consumer system for the completion of the process.
