JMS Export Components
======================
The PXP system will send the message to the producerâ€™s messaging server for offboarding.
The message contains the JSON object, which contains the details of different entities of the PXP system like an article, assets, relationships, and so on.
Once the producer system receives the message from the PXP system, it will send the acknowledgment to the PXP system for the completion of the process.
