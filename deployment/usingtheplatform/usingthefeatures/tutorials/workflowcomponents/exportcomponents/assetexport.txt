**Sr. No.**   **Screen Element**            **Description**
===========   ==========================    ====================================================================================================================================================================================================================
1.            Sheet Name                    The offboarding file is the Excel file. Excel file may contain different sheets in it.
                                            Here, we need to mention the sheet name which contains the articles details.
2.            Primary Key Column            All the articles in an offboarding file have unique identification or IDs.
                                            Within the **Primary Key Column**, we need to define the column name of a sheet
                                            which contains the unique IDs of the products.
                                            Therefore, a system will fetch all the IDs of the articles from the
                                            defined column of the sheet.
3.            Type                          Here, we need to select one of the following options:

                                            *	**Single Class**: Select this option, if all the assets in an offboarding file
                                              use the same class of the system. For example, if all the assets are the **Document**
                                              or all the products are the **Video**.
                                            *	**Column Class**: Select this option, if assets in an offboarding file
                                              use different types of classes of the system.
                                              For example, there are two assets in a sheet; one is the **Document**
                                              and the other one is the **PID**.
                                            The value of this field is based on the selection of **Type** field.

                                              select the **Single Class** option from the Type field. In this case, we need to select that system
