===========   ==========================   ====================================================================================================================================================================================================================
**Sr. No.**   **Screen Element**           **Description**
===========   ==========================   ====================================================================================================================================================================================================================
1.            Consumer IP                  Provide the consumer IP address from where the PXP system will receive the message,
                                           which will contain the details in form of a JSON object.
                                           You need to prepend the protocol of the respective MQ server.
                                           For example, if you are using ActiveMQ,
                                           then use the tcp protocol in the beginning.
                                           **Example of Consumer IP**: tcp://0.0.0.0
2.            Consumer Port                Provide the consumer port number from where the PXP system will receive the message,
                                           which will contain the details in form of a JSON object.
3.            Consumer Queue Name          Enter the consumer queue name, from where the PXP system will receive the message,
                                           which will contain the details in form of a JSON object.
4.            Consumer Acknowledgement     Once the PXP system sends the message to the producer system,
              Queue                        then the PXP system will wait for the acknowledgement from the producer system.
                                           The producer system will send the acknowledgment of the process to the PXP system.
                                           **Producer Acknowledgement Queue** contains the queue name from where the PXP system will receive
                                           the acknowledgment of the completion of the process.
                                           There are following two types of acknowledgments:
                                           *	**Successful Completion**: When the producer system receives the message successfully,
                                           it will send the success message to the PXP system.
                                           *	**Unsuccessful Completion**: When the producer system does not receive a proper message,
                                           or it receives the erroneous message, then it will send the acknowledgment with an error message.
