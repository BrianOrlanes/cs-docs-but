**Sr. No.**   **Screen Element**           **Description**
===========   ==========================   ====================================================================================================================================================================================================================
1.            Consumer IP                  Provide the consumer IP address from where the PXP system will receive the message,
                                           which will contain the details in form of a JSON object.
                                           You need to prepend the protocol of the respective MQ server.
                                           For example, if you are using ActiveMQ,
                                           then use the tcp protocol in the beginning.
                                           **Example of Consumer IP**: tcp://0.0.0.0
2.            Consumer Port                Provide the consumer port number from where the PXP system will receive the message,
                                           which will contain the details in form of a JSON object.
3.            Consumer Queue Name          Enter the consumer queue name, from where the PXP system will receive the message,
                                           which will contain the details in form of a JSON object.
4.            Consumer Acknowledgement     Once the PXP system sends the message to the producer system,
              Queue                        then the PXP system will wait for the acknowledgement from the producer system.
                                           The producer system will send the acknowledgment of the process to the PXP system.
                                           **Producer Acknowledgement Queue** contains the queue name from where the PXP system will receive
                                           the acknowledgment of the completion of the process.
                                           There are following two types of acknowledgments:
                                           *	**Successful Completion**: When the producer system receives the message successfully,
                                           it will send the success message to the PXP system.
                                           *	**Unsuccessful Completion**: When the producer system does not receive a proper message,
                                           or it receives the erroneous message, then it will send the acknowledgment with an error message.

JMS Article Export – Property Configuration
============================================

===========   ==========================   ====================================================================================================================================================================================================================
**Sr. No.**   **Screen Element**           **Description**
===========   ==========================   ====================================================================================================================================================================================================================
1.            Sheet Name                   The offboarding file is the Excel file. Excel file may contain different sheets in it.
					   Here, we need to mention the sheet name which contains the articles details.
2.            Primary 			   All the articles in an offboarding file have unique identification or IDs.
	      Key Column            	   Here, in **Primary Key Column**, we need to define the column name of a sheet
					   which contains the unique IDs of the products.
					   Therefore, a system will fetch all the IDs of the articles from the defined column of the sheet.
3.            Type          		   Here we need to select one of the following options:
					   ●	**Single Class**: Select this option, if all the articles in an offboarding
					   file use the same class of the system. For example,
					   if all the articles are **Individual Article** or all the products are **PID**.

					   ●	Column Class: Select this option, if articles in an offboarding file
					   use different types of classes of the system. For example,
					   there are two products in a sheet;
					   one is the Individual Article and the other one is the PID.

4.            Select Classes/ 		   The value of this field is based on the selection of Type field:
	      Column Name  		   ●	**Select Classes**: When all the articles in an offboarding file
					   use multiple system generated non-nature classes, we select the **Multiple Class**
					   option from the **Type** field.
					   In this case, we need to select that system generated classes from the list.
5.	Multiclassification		   Select this option, if defined articles in a sheet use non-nature classes.
              Queue                        then the PXP system will wait for the acknowledgement from the producer system.

6. 	Type				   As soon as you select **MultiClassification** option, this option will be visible.
					   Here, we need to select one of the options from below mentioned options:
					   ●	**Multiple Class**: Select this option, if articles in an offboarding file u
					   use multiple system generated non-nature classes.

					   ●	**Column Class**: Select this option, if articles in an offboarding file
					   use multiple non-nature classes which are yet to be created.

                                           The producer system will send the acknowledgment of the process to the PXP system.
                                           **Producer Acknowledgement Queue** contains the queue name from where the PXP system will receive
                                           the acknowledgment of the completion of the process.
                                           There are following two types of acknowledgments:
                                           *	**Successful Completion**: When the producer system receives the message successfully,
                                           it will send the success message to the PXP system.
                                           *	**Unsuccessful Completion**: When the producer system does not receive a proper message,
                                           or it receives the erroneous message, then it will send the acknowledgment with an error message.
