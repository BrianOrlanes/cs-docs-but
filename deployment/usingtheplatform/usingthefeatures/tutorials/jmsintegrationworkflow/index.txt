Overview of JMS Integration Workflow
=====================================
JMS (Java Message Service) mechanism is used to communicate with various systems in an enterprise.
JMS is mainly used to send and receive messages from one application to another.
A system sends the message containing the JSON object to another system.
The JSON object will contain all the details of the entities.

**JMS Integration Workflow for Onboarding (Import)**: The PXP system will receive the message from the consumer messaging server while onboarding.
The message contains the JSON object, which contains the details of different entities of the system like an article, assets, relationships, and so on.
The PXP system will fetch all the product details from the JSON object, and it will onboard all the products and other details into the system.
Once the PXP system receives the message from the consumer system, it will send the acknowledgment to the consumer system for the completion of the process.

**JMS Integration Workflow for Offboarding (Export)**: In case of offboarding, the PXP system will send the message to the producerâ€™s messaging server.
The message contains the JSON object, which contains the details of different entities of the PXP system like an article, assets, relationships, and so on.
Once the producer system receives the message from the PXP system, it will send the acknowledgment to the PXP system for the completion of the process.
