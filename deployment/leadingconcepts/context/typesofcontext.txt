Definition and Use
==================

In today’s times, accurately delivering a message via a channel to a given person at a specific time has become a challenge and an opportunity to determine a successful business. CS Global Systems now uses this opportunity to ensure we are using top of the line technology provided to our customers.  The CS Global System has 3 types of contexts which when applied to the products ensure simplicity and minimize duplicity of the content.



Types of Context
=================

Attribute Context
-----------------

Attribute Context can be used in assigning multiple values to attribute that varies with time. For better Product management, it can be used in assigning various Attribute Values.

  **Example:**

  In the I-phone category, there is different price for a model for every year model.

Relationship Context
---------------------

This Relationship Context lets user link several related entities (e.g., images) to a single article. This can be used to give the correct impression of the product’s height, width, depth, and information (if any).

  **Example:**

  A retailer selling dog food would add several images (front side, a back side, and side display) to the main product image to give the customer a better and thorough impression of the product. The back-side image often contains important ingredients information, which assists customer make a purchase.

Version Context
----------------

The feature ‘Version Context’ helps the user create various versions (varies according to the tags) of a product. This feature will create clones of the original product and is particularly helpful when the user needs to run a promotional campaign on one or a few versions of the product.

  **Example:**

  Retailer ‘A’ wants to run a promotion on iPhone 6’s 32 GB and 64 GB variant only during Christmas. He will create variants of the original product through the feature ‘Version Context’ and have a time-bound campaigns running for those.
