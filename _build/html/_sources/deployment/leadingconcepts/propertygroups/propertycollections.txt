Adding Property Collections to Products

What is a Property Collection
==============================

As what the name suggests, a Property Collection is a collection of similar or relevant properties. It is used to group the attributes and tags under one area.
One important aspect of having this feature is that the user can create products that share similar properties without having to add the same attributes and tags all over again.

  **Example:**

  A mobile retailer can create a Property Collection ‘General Information’ with common attributes like PID, GTIN, Brand, Long Description, Short Description, Price, and so on;
  and apply the same to all the products.

  Similarly, one could also create a Property Collection ‘Warranty Information’; this Property Collection can be extended to the other similar products as well.
