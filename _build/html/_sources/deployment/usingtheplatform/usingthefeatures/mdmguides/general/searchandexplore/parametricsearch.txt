Parametric Search
=================
The Parametric Search feature provides general users the ability to search for products or assets using various data fields
that have been used to describe a product or article. The users can narrow down items using the specified criteria.


===================     =============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Attribute:** a data field which describes a product, can also use *'property'*.

**Description:**        * This feature allows searching for products or assets using various/detailed criteria that can narrow down items using fine criteria.
                        * The search is expressed in terms of values of the *Tags*, *Attributes*, and *Roles* in the products/articles.
                        * A user can put the conditions for the filter values.

**Related topics:**     * :doc:`Search within Taxonomy </feature/product_feature/mdm/general/searchandexplore/searchwithintaxonomy>`
                        * :doc:`Multi-faceted Search </feature/product_feature/mdm/general/searchandexplore/facetedsearch>`

**Application:**        * A user can use the advanced filter for conditional search.
                        * A user can use specific detailed search to narrow down items with the help of the fine criteria.
                        * *Examples:*

                            Number attribute can have conditions such as *range, greater than, less than*, etc.

                            Text attribute can have conditions such as *starts with, ends with, contains*, etc.
