Introduction
==============

Marketing communication is an important aspect of all businesses.
It not only boosts the sales but also transforms the way a business is perceived.
One of the old yet most effective forms of marketing communication is ‘Flyer’ or ‘Publication’ i.e. a form of paper advertisement intended for wide distribution
and typically posted or distributed in a public place, handed out to individuals or sent through the mail.
