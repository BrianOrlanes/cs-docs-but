Overview
=========
A bundle is a set of multiple Marketing Products, which are put together to form a bundle. It offers several products for sale as one combined product. The bundle may contain the complementary products. It is used for promotion and marketing of your business products. You can sell a set of products at a lower price than they would cost if the customer buys all of them separately. Bundling allows consumers to benefit from a single, value-oriented purchase of complementary offerings. Pursuing a bundle pricing strategy allows the supplier or retailer to increase the profit by giving customers a discount. A customer has to buy the entire bundle of products. He cannot choose to buy only some of the items from the bundle. For example, a retailer offers the promotional bundle for women that contains a tunic wear, a bag, and a pair of shoes. A customer needs to purchase this bundle as a whole. A retailer can sell this bundle at a lower price then they would cost if a customer buys all of them separately.
