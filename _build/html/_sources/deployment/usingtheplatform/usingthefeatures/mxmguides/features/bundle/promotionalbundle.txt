**Purpose:**               * The purpose of this document is to show you how to make a promotional bundle in the system. You will be guided through the different stages that are involved in the configuration of a promotional bundle.

**Target Audience:**       * Administrators

**Prerequisites:**         * You must have valid credentials to access Contentserv PXP system.
                           * More than one Marketing Products must exist in the system.

**Overview:**              * A bundle is a set of multiple Marketing Products that are put together to form a bundle. It offers several products for sale as one combined product. The bundle may contain complementary products and is used for promotion and marketing of your business products.
                             You can sell a set of products at a lower price compared to the total cost of all the included items. Bundling allows consumers to benefit from a single, value-oriented purchase of complementary offerings.
                             Pursuing a bundle pricing strategy allows the supplier or retailer to increase the profit by giving customers a discount when buying the bundled products. Note that the customer cannot choose to buy only some of the items from the bundle.
                             For example, a retailer offers a promotional bundle for women, and this bundle consists of a tunic wear, a bag, and a pair of shoes. A customer needs to purchase this bundle as a whole. A retailer can sell this bundle at a lower cost compared to the cost of buying the items separately.
