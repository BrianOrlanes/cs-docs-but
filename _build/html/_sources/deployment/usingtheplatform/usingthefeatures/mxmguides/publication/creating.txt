**Slot:** a Slot is a place in a document template where a product is placed while planning a document template in Whiteboard. The planner will split the defined Workable Area of a document template into N number of rows and columns according to his need in Whiteboard. Thus, will create the Slot (a separate space for each product). Then, A planner can place products into separate Slots. Note that one Slot will contain a single product.

**Overview:**  publication is sort of magazine, catalog, brochure, or flyer that is used for the marketing of your products. The planner will plan how a publication should appear using the Whiteboard of the PXP Application. Publication is created from the publication template.
