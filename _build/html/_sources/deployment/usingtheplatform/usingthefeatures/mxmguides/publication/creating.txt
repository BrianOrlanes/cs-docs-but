**Whiteboard:** whiteboard is a feature in Contentserv system, which is similar to Adobe © InDesign © application. There are two types of the target audience who will be involved in the publications. One is a planner who will actually plan the publication. The other one is a designer, who will make the layout and will prepare the templates using Adobe © InDesign © software. Whiteboard will help a planner to plan how a publication should look like.

**Slot:** a Slot is a place in a document template where a product is placed while planning of a document template in Whiteboard. The planner will split the defined Workable Area of a document template into N number of rows and columns according to his need in Whiteboard. Thus, he will create the Slot, which is a separate space for each product. Now, a planner can place products into separate Slots, where one Slot will contain a single product.

**Overview:**  publication is sort of magazine, catalog, brochure, or flyer that is used for the marketing of your products. The planner will plan how a publication should look like using the Whiteboard of the PXP Application. Publication is created from the publication template.

The representation of a publication is based on the created publication template in the system. Publication may contain single or multiple documents/pages as defined in the publication template. The Whiteboard can be used to create/edit the Slot structure on the Publication documents as well as for planning the Marketing Products.
