Whiteboard
===========


Whiteboard is a feature in the Contentserv system, which is similar to Adobe © InDesign © application. There are two types of target audiences who will be involved in the publications.
One is a planner who will actually plan the publication. The other one is a designer who will make the layout and will prepare the templates using Adobe © InDesign © software.
Whiteboard will help the planner to plan how a publication should look like.
