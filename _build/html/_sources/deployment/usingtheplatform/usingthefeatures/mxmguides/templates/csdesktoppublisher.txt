CS Desktop Publisher
=====================


Desktop Publisher is a plugin for simple data transfer and updating functions.
It is available as an additional option for templates and dynamic editing in the print sector.
The Desktop Publisher allows you to use and update Contentserv system objects in Adobe © InDesign © documents.
Frames and individual texts will be assigned to variables which can connect them to system objects like products or images.
This will allow for ease of creating and updating documents which are based on an object or document templates.
