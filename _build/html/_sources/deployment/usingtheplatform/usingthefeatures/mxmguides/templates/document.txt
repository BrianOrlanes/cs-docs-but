Overview
=========

Document template contains guides, styles, page attribute placeholders, "static" elements, and so on. A designer starts the preparation of document template using Adobe © InDesign ©. It is a physical .indd  Adobe © InDesign © file. It does not contain actual information, but it just contains the layout and data dimension. It serves as a starting point of a document. A designer can define the Workable Area in a document template, where a planner can plan and place the products. A designer can use rest of the area of a document template, which is not defined as the Workable Area, to place the header, footer, logo, or background image. Once you create the document template in Adobe © InDesign ©, you can play with it using the Whiteboard of Contentserv system. You can plan how products should be placed in a document template using Whiteboard. You can define Slots in a document template to place the products in the Slots using Whiteboard. These document templates are used in creating publication templates.


Key Terms
==========

**CS Desktop Publisher:**  the Desktop Publisher is an Adobe © InDesign © Plugin for simple data transfer and updating functions. It is available as an additional option for templates and dynamic editing in the print sector.
The Desktop Publisher allows you to use and update Contentserv system objects in Adobe © InDesign © documents. Frames and individual texts will be assigned to variables which can connect them to system objects like products or images.

**Whiteboard:**  whiteboard is a feature in Contentserv system, which is similar to Adobe © InDesign © application. There are two types of the target audience who will be involved in the publications. One is a planner who will actually plan the publication. The other one is a designer, who will make the layout and will prepare the templates using Adobe © InDesign © software. Whiteboard will help the planner to plan how a publication should look like.

**Workable Area:** the workable area is defined while creating a document template in Adobe © InDesign ©. A designer will define this area using an Adobe © InDesign © frame in a document template. The workable area is a dynamic area where products will be placed in Whiteboard.

**Slot:** a slot is a place in a document template where a product is placed while planning of a document template in Whiteboard. The planner will split the defined Workable Area of a document template into N number of rows and columns according to his need in Whiteboard. Thus, he will create a slot, which is a separate space for each product. Now, a planner can place products into separate slots, where one slot will contain a single product.
