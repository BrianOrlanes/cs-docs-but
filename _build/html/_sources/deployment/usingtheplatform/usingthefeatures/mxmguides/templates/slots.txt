=====

Slot is a place in a document template where a product is placed while planning the document template in Whiteboard.
A planner will split the defined Workable Area of a document template into N number of rows and columns according to his need in Whiteboard.
Thus, he will create a slot, which is a separate space for each product.
Now, a planner can place products into separate slots, where one slot will contain a single product.
