1.            Sheet Name                   The offboarding file is the Excel file. Excel file may contain different sheets in it.
                                           Here, we need to mention the sheet name which contains the articles details.
2.            Primary Key Column           All the articles in an offboarding file have unique identification or IDs.
                                           Here, in Primary Key Column, we need to define the column name of the sheet which contains the unique IDs of the articles.
                                           So, a system will fetch all the IDs of the product from the defined column of the sheet.
3.            Type                         Here we need to select one of following options:

                                           * Single Class: Select this option, if all the assets in an offboarding file use the same class of the system.
                                             For example, if all the assets are Document or all the products are Video.
                                           * Column Class: Select this option, if assets in an offboarding file use different types of classes of the system.
                                             For example, there are two assets in a sheet; one is the Document and the other one is the PID.
4.            Class ID/Class Column        The value of this field is based on the selection of Type field.

                                           * Class ID: When all the articles in an offboarding file use the same class of the system, we select the Single Class option from the Type field.
                                             In this case, we need to select that system generated class from the list as Class ID.
                                           * Class Column: When articles in an offboarding file use different classes of the system, we select the Column Class option from the Type field.
                                             In this case, we need to enter the column name of a sheet, which contains the IDs of all the classes in a Class Column field.
5.            Multiclassification          Select this option, if all articles in a sheet use non-nature classes.
6.            Type                         As soon as you select MultiClassification option, this option will be visible. Here, we need to select one of the following options:

                                           * Multiple Class: Select this option, if articles in an offboarding file use multiple system generated non-nature classes.
                                           * Column Class: Select this option, if articles in an offboarding file use multiple non-nature classes which are yet to be created.
7.            Select Classes/Column Name   The value of this field is based on the selection of Type field:

                                           * Select Classes: When all the assets in an offboarding file use multiple system generated non-nature classes, we select the Multiple Class option from the Type field.
                                             In this case, we need to select that system generated non-nature classes from the Select Classes list.
                                           * Class Column Name: When assets in an offboarding file use multiple non-nature classes which are yet to be created, we select the Column Class option from the Type field.
                                             In this case, we need to enter the column name of a sheet, which contains the IDs of all the non-nature classes in a Class Column Name field.
8.            File Source                  This option is used to select the image source. Select from the following options from where you want to import the image:

                                           * From Folder: Enter the path of the folder containing images.
                                           * From URL: the http link of the image is given which will be downloaded and imported to the PXP application.
