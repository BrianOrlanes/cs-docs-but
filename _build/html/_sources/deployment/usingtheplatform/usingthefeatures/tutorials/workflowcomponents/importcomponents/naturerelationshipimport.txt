                                           So, system will fetch all the IDs of the nature relationships from the defined column of the sheet.

6.            contextTagsColumn            Enter the column name of a sheet, which contains the value of the context associated with the relationships.
                                           You only need to enter the value here when you have the context associated with the relationship.
7.            From Date Column Name        This option is present for time-enabled relationships. Enter the column name of a sheet, which contains the effective date of a relationship.
                                           It contains the starting date from when the relationship will be effective.
