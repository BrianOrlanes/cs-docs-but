1.            Sheet Name                   The offboarding file is the Excel file. Excel file may contain different sheets in it.
                                           Here, we need to mention the sheet name which contains the extended articles details. This sheet will contain all non-nature classes.
2.            Primary Key Column           All the extended articles in an offboarding file have unique identification or IDs.
                                           Here, in Primary Key Column, we need to define the column name of a sheet which contains the unique IDs of the extended articles.
                                           So, a system will fetch all the IDs of the extended articles from the defined column of the sheet.
3.            Type                         Here we need to select one of the following options:

                                           * Column Class: Select this option, if all the extended articles in an offboarding file use the same class of the system.
                                           * Multiple Classes: Select this option, if extended articles in an offboarding file use different types of classes of the system.
4.            Column Name/Select Classes   The value of this field is based on the selection of Type field.

                                           * Column Name: When all the extended articles in an offboarding file use the same non-nature class, we select the Column Class option from the Type field.
                                             In this case, we need to enter the column name of a sheet which contains the name of a non-nature class associated with all the extended article.
                                           * Select Classes: When extended articles in an offboarding file use different non-nature classes, we select the Multiple Classes option from the Type field.
                                             In this case, we need to select the non-nature classes associated with different extended articles from the list provided in Select Classes field.
5.            Taxonomies                   Here we need to enter the column name of a sheet of an offboarding file which contains the taxonomy details.
