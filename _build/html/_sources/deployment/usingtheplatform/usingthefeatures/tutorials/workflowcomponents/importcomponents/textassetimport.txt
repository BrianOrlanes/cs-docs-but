=====================================================

**Sr. No.**   **Screen Element**           **Description**
===========   ==========================   ====================================================================================================================================================================================================================
1.            Sheet Name                   The onboarding file is the Excel file. Excel file may contain different sheets in it.
                                           Here, we need to mention the sheet name which contains the text asset details.
2.            Primary Key Column           All the text assets in an onboarding file have unique identification or IDs.
                                           Here, in Primary Key Column, we need to define the column name of a sheet which contains the unique IDs of the text assets.
                                           So, a system will fetch all the IDs of the text assets from the defined column of the sheet.
3.            Type                         Here we need to select one of the following options:

                                           * Single Class: Select this option, if all the text assets in an onboarding file use the same class of the system.
                                             For example, if all the text assets are TextAsset or all the text assets are Language.
                                           * Column Class: Select this option, if text assets in an onboarding file use different types of classes of the system.
                                             For example, there are two types of text assets in a sheet; one is TextAsset and the other one is Language.
4.            Class ID/Column Name         The value of this field is based on the selection of Type field.

                                           * Class ID: When all the text assets in an onboarding file use the same class of the system, we select Single Class option from Type field.
                                             In this case, we need to select that system-generated class from the list as Class ID.
                                           * Class Column: When text assets in an onboarding file use different classes of the system, we select the Column Class option from the Type field.
                                             In this case, we need to enter the column name of a sheet, which contains the IDs of all the classes in the Class Column field.
5.            Multiclassification          Select this option, if text assets in a sheet use non-nature classes.
                                           You only need to enter the value here when you have the context associated with the relationship.
6.            Type                         As soon as you select MultiClassification option, this option will be visible. Here, we need to select one of the options:

                                           * Multiple Class: Select this option, if text assets in an onboarding file use multiple system-generated non-nature classes.
                                           * Column Class: Select this option, if text assets in an onboarding file use multiple non-nature classes which are yet to be created.
7.            Select Classes/Column Name   The value of this field is based on the selection of Type field.

                                           * Select Classes: When all the text assets in an onboarding file use multiple system-generated non-nature classes, we select the Multiple Class option from the Type field.
                                             In this case, we need to select those system-generated classes from the list.
                                           * Class Column Name: When text assets in an onboarding file use multiple non-nature classes which are yet to be created, we select the Column Class option from the Type field.
                                             In this case, we need to enter the column name of a sheet, which contains the IDs of all the non-nature classes in a Class Column Name field.
8.            Taxonomies                   Here we need to enter the column name of a sheet of an onboarding file which contains the taxonomy details.
