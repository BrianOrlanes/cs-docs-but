1.            Sheet Name                   The onboarding file is the Excel file. Excel file may contain different sheets in it.
                                           Here, we need to mention the sheet name which contains the relationship details.
2.            Relationship Column Name     This field is enabled when multiple relationships must be imported into the system.
                                           All the relationships in an onboarding file have unique identification or IDs.
                                           Here, in Relationship Column Name, you need to define the column name of a sheet which contains the unique IDs of the relationships.
                                           So, a system will fetch all the IDs of the relationships from the defined column of the sheet.
3.            sourceIDColumnName           It contains the column name of a sheet, which contains the ID of the class that is selected in Side1 while forming the relationship.
4.            targetIDColumnName           It contains the column name of a sheet, which contains the ID of the class that is selected in Side2 while forming the relationship.
5.            contextIDColumn              Enter the column name of a sheet, which contains the IDs of the context associated with the relationships.
                                           You only need to enter the value here when you have the context associated with the relationship.
6.            From Date Column Name        This option is present for time-enabled relationships. Enter the column name of a sheet, which contains the effective date of a relationship.
                                           It contains the starting date from when the relationship will be effective.
