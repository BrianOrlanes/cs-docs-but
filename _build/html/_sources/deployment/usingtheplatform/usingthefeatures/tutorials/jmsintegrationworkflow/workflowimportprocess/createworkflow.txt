* The **Graph** section in a pop-up window is divided into three vertical sections. The first two vertical sections are called Workflow Modeler.
  It allows to configure workflows using BPMN 2.0 modeling notation. This will allow users to model the complex process using universally known and standardized BPMN 2.0 notation.
  The third vertical section contains the details of each component of JMS integration.

* Drag and drop the notations in Workflow Modeler to define JMS integration import process. The workflow starts with the Start Event,
  which acts as a process trigger. Therefore, the first element in the workflow will be the Start Event.
