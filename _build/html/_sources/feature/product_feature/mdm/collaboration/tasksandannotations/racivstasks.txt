RACI-VS Tasks
==============
The RACI-VS Tasks is a feature that allows users to create a task and assign roles that will check each stage of the task until it is completed and signed off.

**Key Term:**           * **Product Information Management (PIM):** facilitates the central management and maintenance of an enterpriseâ€™s product data, content or any related information.

**Description:**        * This feature allows users to create tasks and assign the checking of the task to users using different roles.
                        * The role assigned to a user can be one of the following: *Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed, Verifier, and Sign off*.
                          These roles have different levels of rights and permissions in the system.
                          The life cycle of a task also depends on the decision of the user assigned to a specific role.

                        * :doc:`Public/Private Tasks </feature/product_feature/mdm/collaboration/tasksandannotations/publicprivatetasks>`

**Application:**        * The review and approval of tasks can be assigned to the roles (roles may then be assigned to users).
                          Each role will have its set of rights and permissions in the system.
                          The task flow explains the various stages of a task starting from *Planned* (initial status) until *Signed off*.
                          It also shows the different roles in charge of validation before the task is endorsed to the next step.
                          Refer to the *Task Flow* image in the *How to do* section.
