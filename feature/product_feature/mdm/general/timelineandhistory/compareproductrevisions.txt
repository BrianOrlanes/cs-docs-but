Compare Product Revisions
=========================
The Compare Product Revision feature allows the selection and comparison of different versions of the same product.


===================     ===============================================================================================================================================================
**Key Term:**           * **Attribute:** a data field which describes a product, can also use *'property'*.

**Description:**        * This feature allows a user to compare versions of a product/article.
                        * This feature gives an overview of the similarities and differences of comparable versions and merge values from any previous version to the newer version.
                        * This feature creates a comparison table that shows columns for the product versions and rows for the attributes.  This table allows quick and easy
                          comparison between each offering's features and characteristics.

**Related topics:**     * :doc:`Edit Data in a Grid View </feature/product_feature/mdm/general/masseditinggridediting/editdatainagridview>`

**Application:**        * A user can track all the changes that are made to a product/article. Based on values, a user can merge a value from a previous version to the newer one.
                        * *Example:*

                            A Red Bull product is created with no short description. Later on, the user adds a description to the product.  When he saves the product
                            with the new description, a version is created. In the timeline, the user can compare these versions and track the changes.
